Sometimes text output can be messy and hard to decipher. Take a look at the standard Linux passwd file:

`cat /etc/passwd`{{execute}}.

It's would be kinder to the eyes to format all the data in the rows into a table with columns.

Find the right Linux command to tabularize the contents of the passwd file into the file `kinder-passwd.txt`.
