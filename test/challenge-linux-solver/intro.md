This is a skill assessment scenario to help strengthen your understanding of the basics of running an application on Kubernetes. Running an application is one of the first Kubernetes skills to master, and you should be comfortable using the command line tool `kubectl` to carry out these fundamental commands.

In this challenge, you will use `kubectl` to rapidly deploy, start, expose, invoke, and update an application&#8212;all from the command line.

**Note** Your keystrokes are being logged and monitored for evaluation purposes.

## Challenge

In the following steps you will be asked to:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;☐ Start an application  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;☐ Expose the application  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;☐ Update the application

If you are unfamiliar with these concepts, [you may want to start with this documentation first](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/kubernetes-basics/deploy-app/deploy-intro/).

When the verification fails, be sure you understand the details of the step's goal(s) and try again. Good luck!

This scenario will self-destruct in 60 minutes.
