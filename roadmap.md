# Roadmap for Solver

This is a list of upcoming considerations to improve the tool:

## Near term feature goals

- Add example challenge scenario using solver, add reference to readme, use as create archetype
- `solver solution` : Solutions encrpyt/decrypt
- `solver create` : From scratch and archetype
- `solver checklist`: Check for required files, use linters to validate json, markdown, and shell script files
- Add more unit testing
- verbose switch for log levels, off in release, on in development 

## Longer term feature goals

- Add .cypress tests to archetypes
- Currently assuming all solutions are in a sh file, instead put all contents in solutions directory into an encrpyted jar.

## Feedback is Important

Your insights as a Challenge author around the authoring process and how to improve this utility and the rest of the platform is important. When you have feedback please consider adding an issue to this project or email me directly jonathan.johnson@dijure.com.
