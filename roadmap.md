# Roadmap for Solver

Upcoming considerations to improve the tool:

## Near term feature goals and issues

- Load solver into challenges with wget from release page.
- Update documentation page on challenges with solver
- Release notes on public repo replace page are blank
- OSX and Windows native binary on release page
- Archetype project created needs version of solver installed
- Test command line for odd ball values, eg. solver all when solutions not decrypted.
- Add more unit testing
- Enhance help descriptions for each command

The current commands for Solver are marked with their implementation and testing status:

| Status  | Command/Switch        | Description |
|---------|-----------------------|-------------|
| âœ”       | -h, --help           | Show this help message and exit. |
| âœ”       | -V, --version        | Print version information and exit. |
| âœ”       | solutions, sol       | Install solutions for testing. Requires authoring passcode placed in challenge source repo. |
| âœ”       | next                 | Solve current task and on success advance current task number |    
| âœ”       | all                  | Solve all remaining tasks |
| ðŸ¤” todo  | until                | Solve all tasks from current task until reaching given task number |
| âœ”       | verify               | Verify task number is complete |
| âœ”       | hint                 | Peak at hint ID for the task number. Omitting # assumes current task |
| âœ”       | view                 | Reveal the verifications, hints, and solutions for a task. |
| âœ”       | reset                | Clear task tracker so next task is assumed to be 1 |
| âœ”       | status               | Get the current step and hint. |
| âœ”       | request_hint         | internal call |
| âœ”       | request_advance_task | internal call |
| âœ”       | create               | Create any missing files that are needed by Solver. Will not overwrite. Must be authoring. |
| ðŸ¤” todo  | check                | Verify the required artifacts for the challenge are present and valid. Can check authoring and challenge environments. |

## Longer term feature goals

- Create archetype for linux works, but could create a few more. A blank/scratch archetype would be helpful.
- Add .cypress tests to archetypes
- Currently assuming all solutions are in a sh file, instead put all contents in solutions directory into an encrpyted zip.
- Perhaps a verbose logging switch, currently logs in /var/log/solver.log
- Consider optional container image on release page.

## Feedback is Important

Your insights as a Challenge author around the authoring process and how to improve this utility and the rest of the platform is important. When you have feedback please consider adding an [issue](https://github.com/javajon/katacoda-solver/issues) to this project or email me directly jonathan.johnson@dijure.com. Issues outside of the solver utility and more about the platform may be submitted to support@katacoda.com.
