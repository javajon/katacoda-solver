# Roadmap for Solver

Upcoming considerations to improve the tool:

## Near term feature goals and issues

- More archetypes for `solver create`, currently just `linux`, `basic` may be next.
- Test command line for oddball values, eg. solver all when solutions not decrypted.
- Enhance help descriptions for each command
- Add more unit testing
- Add .cypress tests to archetypes
- OSX and Windows native binary on the release page

The current commands for Solver are marked with their implementation and testing status:

| Working | Command/Switch        | Description |
|---------|-----------------------|-------------|
| âœ”       | -h, --help           | Show this help message and exit. |
| âœ”       | -V, --version        | Print version information and exit. |
| âœ”       | solutions, sol       | Install solutions for testing. Requires authoring passcode. |
| âœ”       | next                 | Solve current task and on success advance current task number |    
| âœ”       | all                  | Solve all remaining tasks |
| âœ”       | until                | Solve all tasks from current task until reaching given task number |
| âœ”       | verify               | Verify task number is complete |
| âœ”       | hint                 | Get hint give a task number and hint number |
| âœ”       | view                 | Reveal the verifications, hints, and solutions for a task |
| âœ”       | reset                | Clear task tracker so next task is assumed to be 1 |
| âœ”       | status               | Get the next task to solve |
| âœ”       | request_hint         | internal call by hint.sh only |
| âœ”       | request_advance_task | internal call by verify.sh only |
| âœ”       | create               | Create a Challenge project from the given archetype when in authoring context |
| ðŸ¤” todo  | check                | Verify the required artifacts for the challenge are present and valid. Can check authoring and Challenge environments. |

## Longer-term feature goals

- â˜¢ The CLI binary (Linux native) is currently above the 9MB limit for scenario asset size. The CLI binary has been compressed using UPX, but so far cannot be distilled below 9MB. For the time being it is recommended to `wget` the tool from the GitHub release page when the challenge starts. This can potentially lead to the challenge not working if GitHub fails to deliver the artifact due to issues such as GitHub stability, rate limiting, or pure networking.
- Create archetype for Linux works, but could create a few more. A blank/scratch archetype would be helpful.
- Currently assuming all solutions are in a sh file, instead, put all contents in a `solutions` directory into an encrypted zip.
- Perhaps a verbose logging switch currently logs in /var/log/solver.log
- Consider optional container image on the release page.

## Feedback is Important

Your insights as a Challenge author around the authoring process and how to improve this utility and the rest of the platform are important. When you have feedback please consider adding an [issue](https://github.com/javajon/katacoda-solver/issues) to this project. Issues beyond the scope of authoring challenges with _solver_ and more about Katacoda may be emailed to support@katacoda.com.
